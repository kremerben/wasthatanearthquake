*ReactJs* version of a simple website made a few years ago.

Figures out where you are, either by location access granted to the browser,
or by your IP address. Then compares your location to
data retrieved from the USGS.gov earthquake json feed: https://earthquake.usgs.gov.

Comparing the strength and location of recent earthquakes we'll see
if that was a genuine earthquake you felt, or just a truck
rumbling down the street.
